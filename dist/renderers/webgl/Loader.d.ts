/**
 * generic function for representing a value that is possibly asynchronous

 * - it can resolve synchronously
 * - it can be cancelled
 * - it is lazy
 * - it doesn't handle error conditions
 * - it can't be chained
 *
 * const delay = Async((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve('done'), 1000))
 * const cancel = delay((message) => console.log(message))
 * cancel()
 *
 * // compare to the promise equivlanet
 * const delay = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve('done'), 1000))
 * delay.then((message) => console.log(message))
